<p>Hi! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/shivendra-panwar">Shivendra Panwar</a>. I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2013; and my M.S. degree from the same department in 2016, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~akar/">Nail Akar</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests include design and analysis of low-latency cellular networks. Most recently, I have been working on the analysis of blockage-prone millimeter wave (mmWave) networks for vehicular communications, as well as the design and analysis of LTE-5G integration to provide low-latency and high connectivity.</p>

<p>I have spent three summers (2017, 2018 and 2019) collaborating with Futurewei Technologies, where we have investigated machine learning-based methods for improving the performance of link adaptation and carrier aggregation in LTE and 5G NR. I have also collaborated with <a href="https://www.sra.samsung.com/life-at-sra/">Samsung Research America (SRA)</a> during the Summer of 2020 on electric and magnetic fields (EMF)-based power control methods for 5G NR.</p>
