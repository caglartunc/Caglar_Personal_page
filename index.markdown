Hi! I am a Senior Inventive Scientist at AT&T Labs Research, Bedminster, NJ, where I explore cutting-edge communication technologies and services. I received my Ph.D. degree in February 2022, from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [Shivendra Panwar](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/shivendra-panwar). My Ph.D. research focused on the design and analysis of low-latency future cellular networks. I mainly focused on the analysis of blockage-prone millimeter-wave (mmWave) links to provide high-data rate and low-latency mobile access. I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2013; and my M.S. degree from the same department in 2016, under the supervision of Prof. [Nail Akar](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~akar/).

I have spent three summers (2017, 2018 and 2019) collaborating with Futurewei Technologies, where we have investigated machine learning-based methods for improving the performance of link adaptation and carrier aggregation in LTE and 5G NR. I have also collaborated with [Samsung Research America (SRA)](https://www.sra.samsung.com/life-at-sra/) during the Summer of 2020 on electric and magnetic fields (EMF)-based power control methods for 5G NR.
